# LetzPlay Musix

A self-hosted **YouTube jukebox** for a room. One device — an **Android TV box** or a
**laptop/desktop** — connects to a speaker and runs a server. Everyone else on the same Wi-Fi opens
a web page on their phone, logs in with the party password, and queues YouTube songs. The host
device plays them in order; the queue updates live on every phone, and everyone can see who's
connected and who added each track.

Two backends, **one shared web remote**:

| Host | Plays via | Best for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Android TV app** (`android/`) | YouTube IFrame player in a WebView (ToS-compliant), audio out the box's AUX/HDMI | a dedicated TV box left plugged into the speakers |
| **Desktop binary** (`desktop/`) | `mpv` + `yt-dlp`, with a navigable terminal UI to pick the audio output device | a laptop you connect to the speaker for the night |

Both serve the same **React + shadcn/ui** remote (`web/`) and speak an identical JSON/WebSocket
protocol, so a phone doesn't know or care which one it's talking to.

## Repository layout

```
LetzPlayMusix/
├── web/        Shared React + shadcn/ui remote (Vite + Tailwind). Built once, used by both servers.
├── android/    Android TV app (Kotlin, Ktor embedded server, android-youtube-player).
├── desktop/    Go binary (Linux/macOS): mpv playback + Bubble Tea TUI + embedded web server.

└── CLAUDE.md   Architecture & conventions for contributors and AI assistants.
```

The remote is built in `web/` and copied into `android/app/src/main/assets/web` and embedded into
the Go binary at `desktop/internal/webui/dist`. **Always run `scripts/build-web.sh` after changing
anything in `web/`.**

## Features

- 🎵 Paste a YouTube link (watch / `youtu.be` / shorts / embed / live / bare id) → it queues.
- 📜 Live queue: add, remove, reorder. Auto-advances when a song ends.
- 👮 **Login with roles.** A shared *party password* (guest) and an *admin password* (full control).
  Guests manage only songs they added; admins control playback and any song.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Live presence.** See who's connected, and who added each track.
- 🔊 **Desktop:** navigable TUI to choose the audio output device, with live now-playing and controls.
- 📺 **Android TV:** full-screen "now playing" plus a QR code so phones can connect in one scan.
- ⚡ Everything updates in real time over WebSockets — no refreshing.

## Quick start

### Desktop (laptop → speaker)

Prerequisites: **Go 1.22+**, **Node 18+**, and **mpv + yt-dlp** on your PATH.

```bash
# macOS
brew install go node mpv yt-dlp
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install golang nodejs npm mpv && pipx install yt-dlp

# Build the remote + binary, then run
./scripts/build-desktop.sh
./desktop/bin/letzplay --admin-password "letmein" --guest-password "party2026"
```

The TUI opens: pick your audio output with ↑/↓ + Enter, and the printed `http://<your-ip>:8080`
is what guests open. Flags:

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--port` | `8080` | web remote port |
| `--admin-password` | `admin` | grants full control |
| `--guest-password` | `party` | lets guests join |
| `--open` | `false` | accept *any* password as a guest (no guest password) |

**TUI keys:** `↑/↓` select device · `enter` apply · `space` play/pause · `n` skip · `+/-` volume ·
`r` refresh devices · `q` quit.

### Android TV box

Prerequisites: **Android Studio** (or the Android SDK + JDK 17) and **Node 18+**.

```bash
./scripts/build-web.sh                 # builds the remote into the app assets
cd android && ./gradlew installDebug   # or open the android/ folder in Android Studio
```

Launch **LetzPlay Musix** from the TV home screen. The screen shows a QR code and URL; scan it
from a phone on the same Wi-Fi. Audio follows the box's normal output (AUX/HDMI).

> First-run defaults are `admin` / `party`. Change them — see CLAUDE.md for where credentials live.

## Development

```bash
# Web remote with hot reload (proxies /api and /ws to a running server on :8080)
cd web && npm install && npm run dev

# Go tests / Android unit tests
cd desktop && go test ./...
cd android && ./gradlew test
```

## How it fits together

```
        Phones (React + shadcn remote)
                  │  REST + WebSocket  ({snapshot, users})
                  ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────────┐
   │  Server (Android Ktor  OR  Go) │
   │  ┌──────────┐   ┌───────────┐  │
   │  │  Queue   │──▶│  Player   │──┼──▶  Speaker
   │  │ (state)  │   │ (IFrame / │  │
   │  └──────────┘   │   mpv)    │  │
   │   auth + presence└──────────┘  │
   └───────────────────────────────┘
```

The **Queue** is the single source of truth; the **Player** is an interface (`PlaybackController`
in Kotlin, `domain.Player` in Go) so playback logic stays testable and swappable. See
[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the full architecture and conventions.

## License & terms

For personal/home use. The Android app uses YouTube's official IFrame player (ToS-compliant). The
desktop binary uses `mpv`/`yt-dlp` to play audio — review YouTube's Terms of Service for your use.
